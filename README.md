## Visualizations: 
- **Time Series Line plot:** Create an animated line chart or heatmap where the animation progresses through the years. This dynamic visualization can help users see how temperature anomalies change over time.
- **Seasonality and Trends**: 
- **Jointplot**: distribution and linear regression: use it to find if the seasons of the year have an effect on the percentage of temperature change
- **Layered line plot**: check how far off the forecast is from the original data

## Uses of AI:
- Integrating a Question & Answer chatbot into the website to ask specific questions about the project
